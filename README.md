Description of custom sorting algorithm
---------------------------------------

My custom sorting algorithm divides and conquers based on even vs odd integers. It functions in the same way as insertion sort, but makes use of the division of odds and evens to move indices faster. We use even and odd because there is no other way to hit every single index in any given array without looping. Idea for this sorting algorithm stemmed from a list found on <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm>.
